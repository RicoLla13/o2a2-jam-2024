Ah...~ Finally home! Today was such a stressing day, but at least tomorrow's Saturday! Time to relax... But wait! I have a lot of projects and documentations and homework to do... Both my teacher and my boss are gonna kill me if I don't finish them by monday...

* What should I do? I have a bunch of homework to do, but I'm **exhausted**.

> Do your homework! I'm gonna have more free time!

I guess that's the best choice... After all, life is all about being the best!

*two hours pass*

Oh my God...  I really need to sleep, but I haven't finished my documentation for monday yet. 

* What should I do?

>> Life is all about being the best! You can rest when you're dead!

I guess that's the best choice. 

* But...

>>> No buts!~ You can rest when you're dead!

Yes! I can rest when I'm dead...

*A few more hours pass ... but you can barely move yourself...*

Finally, I AM DONE! Wait... What's this? Oh my God I forgot about that my boss asked me to do this project for my colleague! 

* What should I do? I am gonna die if I have to do any more work!

>>>> Finish the project! You can rest when you're dead!

Ugh... I really need to sleep but I-... Yeah, I can sleep when I'm dead.

*So many more hours pass... You can hear the birds chirping... You can't even tell if they're real or not... You haven't slept in over 32 hours...*

*With a tired voice and a lazy eye, now you can finally rest...*

*You can't even finish a line of thought, you fall asleep on the table.*

*You even forgot to set an alarm. You have slept for 24 whole hours. You should have been at school by now.*

Ugh... What's the time? HUH?! 8 AM?! OH MY GOD I'M GONNA BE LATE FOR MY PROJECT PRESENTATION!

* WHAT SHOULD I DO?

>>>>> GO! YOU NEED TO GET TO SCHOOL ASAP! YOU CAN REST WHEN YOU'RE DEAD!

*Swiftly, you get dressed and rush down the stairs to go to school.*

*You didn't even have time to take a bath, or wash your face. You smell horrible.*

*You trip over your feet.*

*. . .*

*You hit your head on the corner of the newel. As you bleed and shrivel in your pain, you can only think of one single thing.*

I wish... I wish I worked less...

*You are now dead. You can finally rest.*

>>>>> It's already late, you might as well just take the bad grade. It does not matter anymore.

But I can't ... My mom would be SO MAD AT ME! If... 

* If she saw me like this...

>>>>>> Your mom is already dead. She can not judge you. After all... you worked hard on this! I'm sure your teacher would understand.

That's right! I deserve some time for myself too! I've worked hard all my life! I'm ENTITLED to some rest.

*You take your time, get dressed, take care of yourself.*

*You have enough time to get to your second class.*

*Projects, school, work, you are proud of yourself for doing everything you had to do.*

*Everything works out great for you today! Congratulations!*

*You return home, fulfilled, ready to rest for another day.*

>>>> Take it easy... You've done enough for today...

But... I- I can't...

*Your face tears up reminiscing of what your mom used to tell you.*

*"Your whole worth as a human being is working until you die! You can rest when you're dead!" she used to day*

Mom... MOM! I FUCKING HATE YOU! 

I- I miss you... 

What should I do, mom!? I AM SO TIRED! I-... 

I can rest when I'm dead? 

. . . 

Then so be it.

*You open your pill cabinet and, with hesitation, you take a bunch of pills into your fist. You think to yourself if it's worth losing your life over work.* 

* *What should YOU do?*

>>>>> Take the pills. You can finally rest.

*With a shaking hand, trembling lips and teary eyes, you decide to shove all of the pills from your cabinet into your mouth.* 

*You choke, but you manage to swallow eventually.*

*Suddenly everything becomes dizzy.*

*You fall on the floor*

*You are now dead. Your whole face is covered in tears and vomit.*

*Nobody even checks on your dead body for weeks.*

*But that's not important now, is it? You are dead. You can finally rest.*

>>>>> It's not worth losing your life for work. You will be fine.

What am I doing? My mom died the same way... I-

*You fall on the floor on your knees.*

*As your eyes begin tearing up, and with a trembling voice, you tell yourself everything will be fine.*

Silly me! I can't believe I thought of taking my own life. 

*You continue your life as if nothing happened.*

*You finish school, leave your part time job and work in a library.*

*It's a simple life, but you are happy*

*Eventually, you get married, have children, get old, and die.*

*You can finally rest.*

> You should really take it easy...

That's right. I need to rest, today was awful! I just. . . wish I had someone to talk to. 

I haven't spoken to anyone outside of work or school in months... 

* What should I do?

>> Call your dad.

*You muster up the courage to call your dad. You haven't spoken to him since...*

*Well, it does not matter. His phone rings... and rings... and rings...*

*But nobody answered.*

Oh... I... I guess I should have expected that. He always said I reminded him of mom... 

>>> Call a classmate.

*You call Lisa, share your struggles, and meet for coffee. Her advice helps you seek support from your boss, who adjusts your workload. You find balance, rediscover joy, and realize life isn't just about working hard but also taking care of yourself. You can finally rest, even though you're not dead.*

>> Call a classmate.

*You call a classmate, Lisa, and share your struggles. Her support encourages you to reach out to your dad. Both conversations help you find balance and seek help from your boss. Adjusting your workload, you rediscover joy and realize you can rest, even though you're not dead.*
